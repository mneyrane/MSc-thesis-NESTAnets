# MSc-thesis-NESTAnets

Numerical experiments for my master's thesis, showcasing unrolled NESTA (NESTAnets[^1]) to recover images from Fourier measurements via TV minimization.

## Requirements

The experiments are written in [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and can be run on any Linux distribution, provided the right Python version is packaged.

To run the experiments without issues, these were run with Python 3.9 and using

[Consider putting together a "requirements.txt" file here and AS-NESTA-net]: #

For convenience, a `requirements.txt` is provided in the repository for ease of installation via `pip`.

## Running the experiments
